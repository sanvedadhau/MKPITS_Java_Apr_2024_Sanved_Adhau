        <h1>Zero Mile</h1>
        Zero Mile Stone (ISO: Śūnya Mailācā Dagaḍa) is a monument built by the British during the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India in 1907 in Nagpur, Maharashtra.
        The Zero Mile Stone consists of a pillar made up of sandstone and another small stone representing the GTS Standard Bench Mark, and four stucco horses that were added later. 
        The height of the top of the pillar is 310.948 m (1,020.17 ft) above mean sea level. In 2008, The Times of India undertook to maintain the monument for the next 5 years
        <br />
        Contrary to the popular belief, there is no verifiable evidence that it is a monument locating the geographical centre of colonial India in the city of Nagpur, 
        Maharashtra or that the Zero Mile Stone was erected by the British to use this point to measure all the distances.
        Nevertheless, the city of Nagpur lies geographically center to all the nine major metros of India, viz. Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kochi, Mumbai, Kolkata, New Delhi and Pune.
