        <h1>Sitabardi Fort</h1>
        Sitabuldi Fort (Marathi: सीताबर्डी किल्ला), site of the Battle of Sitabuldi in 1817, is located atop a hillock in central Nagpur, in the Indian state of Maharashtra. 
        The fort was built by the British after they won this area. Mudhoji II Senasaheb Subha was allowed to continue ruling Nagpur after the British had won the battles of Sitaburdi, Sakkardara, and Nagpur. 
        Richard Jenkins entered into a treaty with Mudhoji on 6 January 1818, which was later ratified by the Governor General.
        <br />
        Article 7 of the treaty stated: "The two hills of Seetabuldee with the bazaars and land adjoining, to a distance to be hereafter specified, 
        shall be henceforth included in the British boundary, and such Military works erected as may be deemed necessary." By this treaty, the British occupied the Sitaburdi hills and large areas on all four sides. However no major construction work was erected on it for next two years.
        The area surrounding the hillock, now known as Sitabuldi, is an important commercial hub for Nagpur.[2] To the south is Nagpur Railway Station and behind it is Tekdi Ganapati, a temple of Ganesha.
        The fort was a home to the Indian Army's 118th infantry battalion (Territorial Army) Grenadiers till 2019.
